   ABOUT THE COMPANY
   Atliq Hardware is a company which supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many clients like Excel stores, Nomad Stores,  Surge Stores and  Electrical Sara Stores across India and they supply all these equipment to them.

Atliq Hardware has a head office in New Delhi India and they have many regional offices across different states in India. Bhavan Patel is the sales director of this company

PROBLEM:

The market is growing dynamically and Bhavan Patel is facing challenges in terms of sales in this dynamically growing market of this business. He has regional managers for North India, South India and Central India and they shared the insights through verbally. So Bhavan Patel is extremely frustrated with this since he could see sales are declining and he could not get the entire picture of the sales insights. He is not able to properly interpret the data through excel files shared by the regional managers.
He needs to focus on s the region where the sales are declining so needs to engage with customers in a more better way.

USUAL BUSINESS SCENARIO FOR DATA ANALYSIS

The Sales data is stored in the MySQL database and is handled by the IT team. Also, we cannot do analytics directly in the database directly since the data volume is high   and we want to make sure that  MySQL database is not affected by the queries which we are using in analytics dashboards like PowerBI. So we have data warehouse where we take data from MySQL(OLTP-online transaction processing system). So we pull the data from OLTP and we perform ETL using  Informatica/Nifi and store it data warehouse like TERRA DATA.
